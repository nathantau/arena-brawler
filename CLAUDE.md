# CLAUDE.md — Arena Brawler (working title)

## What we're building
A mobile real-time PvP arena shooter. Combat feel is inspired by top-down roguelike shooters like Soul Knight: twin-stick movement + aim, auto-aim assist, a wide variety of weapons, energy/mana for weapons, a dodge/skill per character, fast and punchy. Instead of dungeon runs, players are matched into small arenas against other real players.

- Platforms: **iOS first**, Android second. Same codebase.
- All art, names, characters and weapons must be **original** — do not copy Soul Knight assets, names or UI.
- Portrait-locked? No — **landscape** only.

## Tech stack (do not change without asking)
- **Engine:** Godot 4.x (latest stable), **GDScript** with static typing everywhere.
- **Networking:** Authoritative dedicated server = the same Godot project exported **headless** (`--headless`). Clients send inputs only; server simulates and broadcasts state.
  - Transport: ENet (UDP) via Godot high-level multiplayer (`ENetMultiplayerPeer`).
  - Client-side prediction for own movement + server reconciliation; interpolation (~100 ms buffer) for other players and projectiles.
  - Server tick 30 Hz, client sends inputs every physics frame (60 Hz) batched per tick.
- **Matchmaking/accounts (later phase):** Nakama (self-hosted via Docker). Until then, a simple lobby server/direct IP connect for dev.
- **Builds:** Godot export templates → Xcode for iOS; Gradle build for Android.
- **Tests:** GUT (Godot Unit Test) for game logic.

## Game design (MVP scope)
**Modes:** 1v1 Duel and 4-player Free-For-All. First to N kills or highest kills when 3-minute timer ends.
**Arenas:** 2 small hand-built tilemap arenas with cover walls, a few destructible crates, weapon/energy pickups on respawn timers.
**Player:**
- HP + Armor (armor regenerates after 3 s of not taking damage, HP does not).
- Energy pool consumed by weapons; restored by pickups.
- Carry 2 weapons, tap to swap.
- 1 character skill on cooldown (MVP characters: Dash-dodge with i-frames; Deployable shield; Dual-wield burst).
**Weapons (MVP set of ~8):** pistol (free, 0 energy), SMG, shotgun, sniper, rocket (splash), laser beam, melee sword (reflects bullets on swing), bouncing grenade launcher. All data-driven via `Resource` files (`WeaponData.tres`): damage, fire rate, spread, projectile speed, energy cost, crit chance, knockback.
**Controls (mobile):** left virtual joystick = move; right side = attack button with **auto-aim to nearest visible enemy**, optional drag-to-aim on the attack button; skill button; weapon swap button. Haptics on hit.

## Project structure

  /core/        game state, match rules, constants
  /net/         server.gd, client.gd, prediction, interpolation, rpc schemas
  /player/      player controller, input, stats, skills
  /weapons/     weapon base, projectile, weapon_data resources
  /arena/       spawns, pickups, destructibles
  /ui/          hud, joystick, menus
/data/weapons/  *.tres weapon definitions

## Rules for Claude Code
1. **Server-authoritative always.** Never trust client damage, position, ammo or cooldowns. Clients send `{seq, move_vec, aim_vec, fire, skill, swap}` only.
2. Keep simulation logic (movement, projectiles, damage) in plain deterministic-ish functions that both client prediction and server can call. No `randf()` in shared sim without a seeded RNG.
3. Static types in all GDScript. No magic numbers — put tunables in `scripts/core/constants.gd` or weapon/character `.tres` resources.
4. Edit `.tscn` files as text carefully; prefer building nodes in code for anything dynamic.
5. Use placeholder art (colored shapes) — don't block on art.
6. Every gameplay rule (damage calc, armor regen, energy cost, kill scoring) gets a GUT test.
7. Mobile performance: target 60 fps on iPhone 11. Pool projectiles; avoid per-frame allocations; keep draw calls low.
8. After each milestone, update the **Status** section below and commit with a clear message.
9. Ask before adding new dependencies or changing the stack.

## Milestones
1. **M1 – Local combat feel (single player vs dummy bots):** movement, joystick, auto-aim, 3 weapons, energy, HP/armor, dash skill, one arena. Make it *feel good* before networking.
2. **M2 – Networking:** headless server, 2 clients on LAN, prediction + reconciliation + interpolation, server-side hit detection.
3. **M3 – Match loop:** lobby, 1v1 + FFA modes, timer, scoring, respawns, pickups, results screen.
4. **M4 – Content:** all 8 weapons, 3 characters, 2 arenas, juice (screenshake, hit flash, particles, haptics, SFX).
5. **M5 – iOS build:** export to Xcode, TestFlight build, test on real device over internet against a cloud-hosted server (Docker).
6. **M6 – Online services:** Nakama accounts, matchmaking queue, basic MMR.
7. **M7 – Android build** + device testing.

## Commands
- Run client: `godot --path . `
- Run client with touch controls on desktop (mouse emulates touch): `godot --path . -- --touch`
- Run headless server: `godot --path . --headless -- --server --port 7777`
- Tests: `godot --path . --headless -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gdir=res://tests -gexit`
- iOS export: `godot --path . --headless --export-release "iOS" build/ios/ArenaBrawler.xcodeproj`

## Status
- [~] **M1 – implemented, needs a hands-on feel pass** (2026-10-28)
  - Done: floating joystick + FIRE (auto-aim, drag-to-aim) / DASH / SWAP touch buttons; WASD + mouse/J/Space/Q on desktop;
    auto-aim to nearest visible enemy with target ring; Pocket Blaster (free), Buzzsaw SMG, Scattercannon;
    energy; HP + armor regen; dash with i-frames; 3 dummy bots; kill/death tally; respawn at safest spawn; one arena ("Pit").
  - Sim lives in pure classes (`PlayerStats`, `WeaponState`, `Loadout`, `DashSkill`, `MovementSim`, `CombatRules`, `AutoAim`)
    driven by `Player.simulate(InputFrame, delta)` with a per-player seeded RNG, ready for server + prediction in M2.
  - Projectiles: fixed 512-slot pool, raycast per step, one `_draw` for all bullets.
  - 56 GUT tests passing.
  - Temporary M1 shortcuts: arena is an ASCII layout (`scripts/arena/arena_layouts.gd`) rather than a TileMap; no pickups yet,
    so energy only refills on respawn; dev weapon cycling via `R` / the "W" touch button (remove once pickups land in M3).
- [ ] M2 not started
